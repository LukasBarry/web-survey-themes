# Web Survey Themes

Created to test different color schemes on web survey, to see how they look. Once satisfied with the look of the color scheme, just copy the resulting hash and send it over to the dev team to add to the business's settings.

## To Use:

- Select the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors from the dropdown color pickers
- Click the `Submit` button
- View how the survey would look with those selected colors
- Once satisfied, copy the resulting hash with the selected colors and send it over to a member of the dev team to add to the business's settings

### To Clone:

- Navigate to the directory you want in your local file tree
- Copy the link from the github repository under the 'Clone or download' dropdown
- Run `git clone <link>` locally to create the new repository
- Run `npm start` to launch project in browser
- Begin making any changes!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
